- name: Run E2E Admin Tests
  run: npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/flows/admin-dashboard.test.js

- name: Upload Test Results
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3

    path: playwright-report/
```

### Quality Gates

E2E tests serve as quality gates preventing deployment of:
- Performance regressions in gallery loading
- Authentication security vulnerabilities  
- Admin dashboard functionality breaks
- Mobile responsiveness issues
- Accessibility compliance violations
- Network resilience failures and timeout issues
- Data corruption during network interruptions
- Inadequate error handling during connectivity issues
- Missing offline indicators and graceful degradation
- Poor user experience under slow network conditions

This comprehensive E2E test suite ensures the A Lo Cubano Boulder Fest website maintains high quality, performance, security, and network resilience standards across all Phase 2 gallery features, admin panel operations, and Phase 4 advanced network failure scenarios.
