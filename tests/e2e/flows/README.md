- name: Upload Test Results
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: playwright-report
    path: playwright-report/
```

### Quality Gates

E2E tests serve as quality gates preventing deployment of:
- Performance regressions in gallery loading
- Authentication security vulnerabilities  
- Admin dashboard functionality breaks
- Mobile responsiveness issues
- Accessibility compliance violations

This comprehensive E2E test suite ensures the A Lo Cubano Boulder Fest website maintains high quality, performance, and security standards across all Phase 2 gallery and admin panel features.
