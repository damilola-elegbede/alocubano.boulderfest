## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Typography First**: Text is the primary design element
2. **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Clean, focused, distraction-free
3. **Cultural Authenticity**: Respectful representation of Cuban culture
4. **Performance Focused**: Fast loading, smooth interactions
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

### Visual Language
- **Bold Typography**: Using display fonts for impact
- **Strategic Color**: Red accents on monochrome base
- **Generous Whitespace**: Let content breathe
- **Subtle Animation**: Enhance, don't distract
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Guide the eye naturally

### Reference Standards
The **Artists** and **Schedule** pages exemplify the ideal balance and simplicity for this website:
- **Artists Page**: Demonstrates creative typography use with consistent card patterns
- **Schedule Page**: Shows clean, scannable information hierarchy with minimal styling

These pages should be used as the standard for all other page designs.

## Quick Reference

### Colors
- Primary: `#000000` (Black)
- Secondary: `#FFFFFF` (White)
- Accent: `#CC2936` (Cuban Red)
- Support: `#5B6BB5` (Cuban Blue)

### Fonts
- Display: `Bebas Neue`
- Accent: `Playfair Display`
- Monospace: `Space Mono`
- Body: `Inter`

### Breakpoints
- Mobile: `< 768px`
- Tablet: `768px - 1024px`
- Desktop: `> 1024px`

## Implementation Notes
- All specifications use CSS custom properties for maintainability
- Mobile-first responsive approach
- Progressive enhancement for animations
- Semantic HTML structure throughout
