## Database Schema

### Enhanced Audit Logs Table

The existing `audit_logs` table has been enhanced with reconciliation fields:

```sql

net_amount_cents INTEGER NULL
external_reference TEXT NULL
dispute_status TEXT NULL
```

console.log(`Transaction Count Variance: ${report.transaction_count_variance}`);
```

### Check Financial Health

```javascript
import financialReconciliationService from './lib/financial-reconciliation-service.js';

const healthStatus = await financialReconciliationService.getFinancialHealthStatus();

console.log(`Financial Health: ${healthStatus.status}`);
console.log(`Reconciliation Rate: ${healthStatus.reconciliation_rate}%`);

```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required for Stripe integration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...

# Database configuration
TURSO_DATABASE_URL=libsql://...
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=...

# Admin access
ADMIN_PASSWORD=... (bcrypt hash)
ADMIN_SECRET=... (min 32 chars)
```

### Fee Rate Configuration

Fee rates are configured in the service and can be updated as needed:

```javascript
this.stripeFeeRates = {
  card: { rate: 0.029, fixed: 30 },
  international: { rate: 0.044, fixed: 30 },
  amex: { rate: 0.035, fixed: 30 },
  ach: { rate: 0.008, fixed: 0, max: 500 }
};
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Key Metrics

1. **Reconciliation Rate**: Percentage of transactions reconciled within 24 hours
2. **Financial Health Score**: Composite score based on reconciliation and discrepancy rates
3. **Settlement Accuracy**: Percentage of settlements matching bank deposits
4. **Dispute Rate**: Percentage of transactions disputed by customers
5. **Fee Variance**: Difference between calculated and actual Stripe fees

### Alert Thresholds

- **Critical**: Reconciliation rate < 60% or >25 unresolved discrepancies
- **Warning**: Reconciliation rate < 80% or >10 unresolved discrepancies
- **Healthy**: Reconciliation rate >= 95% and <5 unresolved discrepancies

### Dashboard Metrics

The admin dashboard displays:

- Real-time financial health status
- Daily reconciliation summary
- Outstanding discrepancies requiring attention
- Fee variance analysis
- Settlement status overview
- Compliance scoring

## Performance Optimization

### Database Indexes

The system includes performance-optimized indexes:

```sql
-- Financial event queries
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_financial ON audit_logs(event_type, amount_cents, currency);

-- Reconciliation status tracking
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_reconciliation_status ON audit_logs(reconciliation_status, created_at DESC);

-- Settlement tracking
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_settlement ON audit_logs(settlement_id, settlement_date);
```

### Query Optimization

- Materialized views for common aggregations
- Efficient date range queries with proper indexing
- Pagination support for large result sets
- Connection pooling for database performance

### Caching Strategy

- Daily reports cached for 1 hour
- Financial health status cached for 15 minutes
- Audit statistics cached for 30 minutes
- Settlement data cached for 4 hours

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
