- **Google Wallet Service** (`api/lib/google-wallet-service.js`)
  - Google Wallet API integration
  - Event ticket class management
  - JWT-based save links
  - Pass object creation and updates

#### 2. Database Schema

- **Migration 007_wallet_integration.sql**
  - Added wallet tracking fields to tickets table

## Configuration Requirements

### Apple Wallet (Not Yet Configured)

To enable Apple Wallet, you need:

1. Apple Developer Account
2. Pass Type ID (e.g., `pass.com.alocubano.tickets`)
3. Pass Certificate (.p12 format, base64 encoded)
4. Apple WWDR Certificate (base64 encoded)
5. Team ID from Apple Developer account

Environment variables needed:

```bash
APPLE_PASS_TYPE_ID=pass.com.alocubano.tickets
APPLE_TEAM_ID=YOUR_TEAM_ID
APPLE_PASS_CERT=BASE64_P12_CERT
APPLE_PASS_PASSWORD=P12_PASSWORD
APPLE_WWDR_CERT=BASE64_WWDR_CERT
```

### Google Wallet (Not Yet Configured)

To enable Google Wallet, you need:

1. Google Cloud Console project
2. Google Wallet API enabled
3. Service Account with Wallet Object Writer role
4. Issuer ID from Google Pay & Wallet Console

Environment variables needed:

```bash
GOOGLE_WALLET_ISSUER_ID=YOUR_ISSUER_ID
GOOGLE_WALLET_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=BASE64_JSON_KEY
```

## Testing

### Test Script

Created `scripts/test-wallet.js` to verify:

- Service configuration status
- Pass generation (when configured)
- Database integration
- Event tracking

### Current Status

- ✅ Database schema updated
- ✅ Wallet services implemented
- ✅ API endpoints created
- ✅ UI integration complete
- ✅ Test infrastructure ready
- ⏳ Awaiting Apple/Google credentials

## How It Works

### Pass Generation Flow

1. Ticket created in database during purchase
2. Wallet passes optionally generated after ticket creation
3. Pass IDs stored in database for tracking
4. Users can download passes via:
   - Email confirmation links
   - My Tickets portal buttons
   - Direct API endpoints

### Pass Contents

Both wallet types include:

- Event name and dates
- Ticket type and ID
- Attendee name
- Venue location
- QR code for scanning
- Order number
- Terms and conditions

## Next Steps

### To Enable in Production

1. **Apple Wallet**:
   - Create Pass Type ID in Apple Developer account
   - Generate and export pass certificate
   - Download WWDR certificate
   - Convert certificates to base64
   - Add to Vercel environment variables

2. **Google Wallet**:
   - Create Google Cloud project
   - Enable Wallet API
   - Create service account
   - Get issuer ID from Pay Console
   - Add credentials to Vercel

3. **Deploy**:
   - Push to main branch
   - Vercel will auto-deploy
   - Test with real device

### Optional Enhancements

- Push notifications for pass updates
- Dynamic pass updates (schedule changes)
- Personalized pass backgrounds
- Multi-language support
- Analytics tracking

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files

- `api/lib/apple-wallet-service.js`
- `api/lib/google-wallet-service.js`
- `api/tickets/apple-wallet/[ticketId].js`
- `api/tickets/google-wallet/[ticketId].js`
- `migrations/007_wallet_integration.sql`
- `scripts/create-wallet-images.js`
- `scripts/test-wallet.js`
- `public/wallet/` (6 Apple Wallet images)
- `public/images/wallet/` (2 Google Wallet images)

### Modified Files

- `api/lib/ticket-service.js` - Added wallet generation after ticket creation
- `api/lib/ticket-email-service.js` - Added wallet buttons to emails
- `pages/my-tickets.html` - Added wallet download buttons
- `package.json` - Added wallet dependencies

## Dependencies Added

- `passkit-generator` - Apple Wallet pass generation
- `google-auth-library` - Google API authentication
- `jsonwebtoken` - JWT for Google Wallet links
- `sharp` - Image processing for wallet assets
- `uuid` - Unique identifier generation

## Security Considerations

- Certificates stored as base64 environment variables
- Pass serial numbers are unique and cryptographically random
- Service account credentials never exposed to client
- API endpoints validate ticket existence
- No sensitive data in pass barcodes

## Success Metrics

When fully configured, success indicators:

- Wallet passes generated for 100% of new tickets
- Downloads tracked in wallet_pass_events table
- Zero errors in production logs
- Positive user feedback on convenience

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Not configured" errors**: Add required environment variables
2. **Certificate errors**: Ensure base64 encoding is correct
3. **Google API errors**: Verify service account permissions
4. **Image not showing**: Check image dimensions match requirements

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test wallet configuration
node -r dotenv/config scripts/test-wallet.js dotenv_config_path=.env.local

# Check migration status
node -r dotenv/config scripts/check-migrations.js dotenv_config_path=.env.local

# Regenerate wallet images
node scripts/create-wallet-images.js
```

## Conclusion

The mobile wallet integration is fully implemented and ready for activation. Once Apple and Google credentials are configured, attendees will be able to add their tickets to their mobile wallets for convenient, offline access at the event.

**Implementation Date**: January 7, 2025
**Branch**: `feature/mobile-wallet-integration`
**Status**: Ready for credential configuration and production deployment
