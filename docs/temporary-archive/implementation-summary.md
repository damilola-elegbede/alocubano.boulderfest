## Parallel Execution Opportunities

### Phase 1 (Parallel)
- PR1: Migration Runner (independent)
- PR2: Distributed Locking (independent)

### Phase 2 (Parallel)
- PR2: Performance Optimization (can start with PR1)
- PR3: API Endpoints (can start with PR1)

### Phase 3 (Mixed)
- PR1: Monitoring (can start early)
- PR2: Testing requires all previous PRs

## Key Deliverables

### Code Files
1. `api/lib/migration-runner.js` - Core migration logic
