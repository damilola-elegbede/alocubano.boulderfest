## Maintenance Procedures

### Weekly

- Monitor unit test execution time (should remain <1 second)
- Verify all 26 unit tests pass consistently
- Check E2E test success rate and execution time
- Review any new test failures or flaky tests

### Monthly

- Update test dependencies (Vitest, Playwright)
- Review test file organization and structure
- Validate E2E database management automation
- Assess test coverage and identify gaps

### Quarterly

- Comprehensive browser compatibility testing updates
- E2E test infrastructure optimization

- Performance baseline reassessment

## Migration from Complex Test Suite

### Before Streamlining

- Multiple test frameworks and configurations
- Complex test environment setup
- Longer execution times and higher resource usage
- Difficult maintenance and debugging
- Over-engineered abstractions

### After Streamlining (Current)

- **Single framework**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E
- **Simple configuration**: Minimal config files
- **Fast execution**: <1 second for 26 unit tests, 2-5 minutes for E2E
- **Low resource usage**: <50MB for unit tests
- **Easy maintenance**: 5 unit test files, 12 focused E2E tests
- **Clear separation**: Unit tests for API contracts, E2E for user workflows
- **Database strategy**: SQLite for unit tests, Turso for E2E tests

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Developer Experience

1. **Fast Feedback Loop**: Unit tests provide immediate validation
2. **Watch Mode**: `npm run test:simple:watch` for continuous testing
3. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automatic test execution before commits
4. **E2E on Demand**: Full browser testing when needed
5. **Health Monitoring**: Real-time database and API health checks

### CI/CD Integration

1. **Parallel Execution**: Unit and E2E tests can run in parallel
2. **Artifact Collection**: Screenshots, videos, and HTML reports
3. **Environment Isolation**: Separate databases for different test types
4. **Quality Gates**: Prevent deployment on test failures
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Track test execution trends

## Key Principles

### Simplicity First

- **No test abstractions**: Every test readable by any JavaScript developer
- **Direct API testing**: No complex mocking or test infrastructure
- **Standard tools**: Vitest and Playwright with minimal configuration
- **Clear separation**: Unit tests for APIs, E2E tests for user workflows

### Speed and Reliability

- **Fast unit tests**: Complete in under 1 second
- **Reliable E2E tests**: Production-like environment with Turso
- **Minimal dependencies**: Reduced complexity and failure points
- **Consistent execution**: Same performance across environments

### Maintainability

- **Few files**: 5 unit test files, 12 E2E test files
- **Clear structure**: Organized by functionality, not abstraction
- **Simple debugging**: Direct test failures without complex stack traces
- **Easy updates**: Minimal configuration to maintain

This streamlined testing strategy ensures the A Lo Cubano Boulder Fest website maintains high quality, performance, and security standards while being easy to maintain and extend.
