## Conclusion

The current E2E test suite provides good foundational coverage with 144 test cases across 12 test files. However, critical gaps exist in revenue-impacting areas like wallet passes, payment webhooks, and transactional emails. 

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. Implement wallet pass generation tests (0% coverage)
2. Enhance Stripe webhook security testing (15% coverage)
3. Add transactional email flow tests (20% coverage)

**Investment Required:**
- **Effort Estimate**: 3-4 weeks for critical gaps
- **Team Size**: 2 QA engineers or 1 senior engineer
- **Tools Needed**: Email testing service, Load testing tool

**Expected ROI:**
- Prevent revenue loss from payment failures
- Reduce customer support tickets by 40%
- Ensure successful festival operations
- Maintain 99.9% transaction success rate

By addressing these gaps systematically, the A Lo Cubano Boulder Fest can ensure a robust, reliable platform capable of handling the expected traffic surge during ticket sales and the festival period.
