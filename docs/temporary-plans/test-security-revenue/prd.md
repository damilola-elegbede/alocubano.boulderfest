# Product Requirements Document: Test Infrastructure Security & Revenue Protection
## A Lo Cubano Boulder Fest

### Executive Summary

This PRD defines the implementation of 4 critical test infrastructure improvements that protect revenue streams and address security vulnerabilities. The implementation maintains the remarkable 96% complexity reduction achievement (419→475 lines) while adding surgical protections for business-critical operations.

**Scope**: SQL injection prevention, payment validation, JWT security, XSS protection, code standardization  
**Impact**: Revenue protection, security hardening, maintainability improvement  
**Constraint**: 56 lines maximum addition across 4 tasks

### Business Objectives

1. **Revenue Protection**: Prevent payment manipulation that could result in revenue loss
2. **Security Hardening**: Block SQL injection, JWT manipulation, and XSS attacks
3. **Code Quality**: Standardize HTTP status codes for consistency
4. **Maintain Simplicity**: Preserve the 96% complexity reduction achievement

### Technical Requirements

#### Security Requirements
- SQL injection attempts must never return HTTP 200
- JWT manipulation attempts must return 401/403
- XSS payloads must be sanitized in responses
- All network failures must throw descriptive errors

#### Payment Requirements
- Negative prices must be rejected (400/422)
- Micro-amount spam must be blocked
- Stripe checkout session validation required
- Payment webhook → ticket generation flow verification

#### Code Standards
- HTTP status codes as named constants
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Direct API testing (no mocking)
- Zero abstractions philosophy

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Critical Security Fixes
**Timeline**: Day 1  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  

- **PR 1**: SQL Injection Test Implementation
  - Add SQL injection test to basic-validation.test.js
  - Test common SQL injection patterns
  - Ensure 400/422 responses (never 200)

- **PR 2**: Security-Critical Tests
  - Create security-critical.test.js
  - JWT manipulation prevention
  - XSS payload sanitization

#### Phase 2: Revenue Protection & Standards
**Timeline**: Day 2  
**Priority**: HIGH  

- **PR 3**: Payment-Critical Tests
  - Create payment-critical.test.js
  - Payment amount manipulation prevention
  - Stripe checkout flow validation

- **PR 4**: HTTP Status Constants
  - Add constants to helpers.js
  - Standardize status code usage
  - Improve code maintainability

### Success Metrics

#### Performance Metrics
- Test execution time: <500ms (current: 395ms)
- Memory usage: <100MB
- Zero test flakiness
- 100% CI/CD success rate

#### Security Metrics
- 0% SQL injection success rate
- 0% JWT bypass success rate
- 0% XSS payload rendering
- 100% malicious payment rejection

#### Quality Metrics
- New developer onboarding: <1 hour
- Test modification time: <5 minutes
- Code review approval: first pass
- Zero abstraction violations

### Risk Assessment

#### Implementation Risks
- **Risk**: Test execution time increase
  - **Mitigation**: Strict 56-line limit, parallel test execution
  
- **Risk**: Complexity creep
  - **Mitigation**: Principal architect constraint, zero abstractions enforced

#### Business Risks Addressed
- **Revenue Loss**: Payment validation prevents underpriced tickets
- **Security Breach**: JWT/SQL injection protection prevents admin compromise
- **Data Exposure**: XSS prevention protects user data
- **Reputation Damage**: Security hardening prevents public exploits

### Dependencies

#### Technical Dependencies
- Existing test infrastructure (Vitest)
- CI server (already configured)
- Test helpers (already implemented)

#### No New Dependencies
- No additional npm packages
- No test frameworks
- No mocking libraries
- No external services

### Timeline

**Total Duration**: 2 days

#### Day 1: Security Implementation
- Morning: SQL injection test (15 minutes)
- Morning: Security-critical tests (30 minutes)
- Afternoon: Validation and review

#### Day 2: Revenue & Standards
- Morning: Payment-critical tests (30 minutes)
- Morning: HTTP constants (5 minutes)
- Afternoon: Final validation

### Constraints

1. **Line Count**: Maximum 56 lines total addition
2. **File Count**: 2 new test files, 2 file modifications
3. **Execution Time**: Maintain <500ms total
4. **Philosophy**: Zero abstractions, direct API testing
5. **Complexity**: No regression from 96% reduction achievement

### Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Remove new test files
2. Revert modifications to existing files
3. Restore original test suite (419 lines)
4. Document failure reasons
5. Re-evaluate approach

### Long-term Maintenance

- Monthly security test review
- Quarterly payment flow validation
- Annual complexity audit
- Continuous execution time monitoring

### Approval

This PRD has been approved based on:
- Principal architect review
- 96% complexity reduction preservation
- Business-critical focus only
- Surgical implementation approach

**Status**: APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION
