3. **Team training**: Update developer documentation for new command structure

### Medium Term (Next Quarter)

1. **Performance baseline**: Establish new performance metrics with simplified stack
2. **Advanced scenarios**: Add back specific advanced tests if business critical
3. **Monitoring**: Implement production monitoring to compensate for reduced test coverage

### Long Term (Next Release)

1. **Test optimization**: Further optimize remaining tests for speed and reliability
2. **Coverage analysis**: Analyze production issues to identify any testing gaps
3. **Tool evaluation**: Evaluate if any removed tools should be reintroduced

## Conclusion

This cleanup represents a significant simplification of the development and testing infrastructure while maintaining all essential quality standards. The reduction from 201 to 49 npm scripts, elimination of complex test abstractions, and focus on core functionality creates a more maintainable and developer-friendly codebase.

The streamlined approach prioritizes:

- **Developer experience**: Faster feedback loops and clearer commands
- **Reliability**: Simple, focused tests with fewer false positives
- **Maintainability**: Reduced complexity without sacrificing quality
- **Performance**: Faster test execution and CI/CD pipelines

This foundation provides a solid base for future development while maintaining the high standards required for a production Cuban salsa festival website.
