# DEPRECATED: This workflow has been replaced by post-merge-validation.yml
# 
# The new workflow fixes:
# - Port conflicts from hardcoded port 3000
# - Process cleanup issues  
# - Test redundancy (running same tests multiple times)
# - Inconsistent environment configurations
#
# This file is kept for reference only and will be removed in a future update.
# DO NOT USE THIS WORKFLOW
