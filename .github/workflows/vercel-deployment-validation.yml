# DEPRECATED: This workflow has been consolidated into specialized workflows
#
# Functionality distributed to:
# - deployment-health-monitor.yml: PR preview health monitoring
# - production-quality-gates.yml: Production deployment validation
# - performance-tests.yml: Dedicated performance testing
# - ci.yml: Core code quality validation
#
# This consolidation eliminates redundant triggers and provides clearer separation of concerns.
# Each workflow now has a specific, unique purpose to avoid duplicate runs.
#
# This file kept temporarily for reference, will be removed in next cleanup phase.
