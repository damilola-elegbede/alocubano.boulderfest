# Security Audit Summary

## Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

1. **REMOVED HARDCODED SECRETS** ✅
   - Eliminated 'test-secret-key-that-is-at-least-32-characters-long' fallback
   - Added comprehensive secret validation with pattern detection
   - Implemented secure environment variable requirements

2. **FIXED AUTHENTICATION MOCKING** ✅ 
   - Replaced API mocking with real security validation
   - Added security header validation in tests
   - Implemented response sanitization checks
   - Enhanced error handling without information leakage

3. **RESOLVED MEMORY LEAKS** ✅
   - Added comprehensive cleanup for performance observers
   - Implemented proper error handling in observer setup
   - Added memory overflow protection (1000 item limits)
   - Enhanced cleanup on page unload events

4. **ENHANCED ERROR HANDLING** ✅
   - Added security event logging system
   - Implemented proper error handling with security context
   - Created global security audit log
   - Enhanced timeout handling and recovery mechanisms

## Security Features Added

- Production environment protection for mock functions
- JWT algorithm specification (HS256 only) 
- Session cookie security validation
- Security header validation
- Information leakage prevention
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Memory leak prevention mechanisms
- Cross-test security tracking

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# REQUIRED - Secure admin secret (32+ characters, no test patterns)
ADMIN_SECRET=your-cryptographically-secure-secret-key

# OPTIONAL - Enable security event logging
LOG_SECURITY_EVENTS=true
```

## Test Security Status: SECURE ✅

All critical security vulnerabilities have been resolved while preserving test functionality.
