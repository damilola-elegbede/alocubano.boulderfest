## [Unreleased]

### Fixed - E2E Test Suite Reliability (October 2025)

#### Test Quality Improvements
- **Eliminated Silent Test Passes**: Fixed 26+ instances where tests could silently pass without running assertions
  - Replaced early `return;` statements with proper `test.skip(true, 'reason')` across 5 test files
  - Fixed improper `test.skip()` usage without the `true` parameter inside running tests
  - Added explicit error throwing for prerequisite failures instead of silent returns
- **Converted Inappropriate Skips to Failures**: Fixed ~15 tests that were hiding real bugs by skipping
  - Tests now FAIL when features are broken (CSRF unavailable, admin login fails, API errors)
  - Only skip for valid reasons (rate limiting, MFA required)
  - Added proper empty state testing instead of skipping when data is empty
- **GitHub Actions Workflow Improvements**: Enhanced `.github/workflows/e2e-tests-preview.yml`
  - Removed `|| true` pattern that hid missing critical secrets
  - Implemented proper exit code handling that correctly detects test failures
  - Added critical vs. optional secret categorization
- **Test Quality Helper**: Added `tests/e2e/helpers/test-quality.js` with assertion tracking utilities
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Created `tests/e2e/README.md` with best practices and historical issues

#### Impact
- **Before**: 26+ tests could silently pass, ~18 skips hiding real bugs
- **After**: All tests properly fail when features broken, ~4 valid skips remaining
- **Result**: Tests now accurately reflect system health

### Fixed - Integration Test Suite Reliability

#### Test Suite Stabilization (100% Pass Rate Achieved)
- **Rate Limiting Tests**: Fixed rate limiter integration with test mode to properly validate rate limiting logic
- **Security Monitoring**: Resolved audit log filtering to correctly query by action type for security scoring tests
- **Webhook Validation**: Fixed security alert race conditions and cooldown key collisions
- **Email Confirmation**: Added mock email record insertion in integration test mode
- **Mountain Time Formatting**: Corrected timestamp format validation to handle both SQLite and ISO formats

#### Root Cause Fixes Applied
- **Service Initialization**: Added explicit `ensureInitialized()` calls before security alert operations
- **Cooldown Management**: Changed cooldown key to use `correlationId` for unique webhook alert tracking
- **Test Mode Logic**: Removed test mode bypasses where validation was required
- **Database Records**: Ensured email records created in integration test mode for verification
- **Type Conversion**: Added proper handling for Date/BigInt objects from SQLite

**Test Results**: 72 test files passed | 1000 tests passed | 38 skipped (1038 total) | 100% pass rate
